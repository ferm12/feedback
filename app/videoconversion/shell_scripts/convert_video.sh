 #For webm -b:v will try to reach the specified bit rate on average, e.g. 1 MBit/s.
 #Choose a higher bit rate if you want better quality. Note that you shouldn't leave out the -b:v option as the default settings will produce mediocre quality output.
 #the target bitrate becomes the maximum allowed bitrate spcified by the -crf parameter. By default the CRF value can be from 4â€“63, and 10 is a good starting point. Lower values mean better quality
